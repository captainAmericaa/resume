 Kindly ignore this mail if action, on the below points, has already been taken by you:

 

1.    Reporting time and location while on bench: Please make sure that you are available in office during the official working hours (8:30 AM – 6 PM). While on bench, you need to report at Talwade office only since most of the project interviews / discussions would happen in Talwade unless specified otherwise. Reporting at any other location without a prior approval (on mail) from the respective staffing partner and / or bench manager and / or people partner may result in a disciplinary action and no timesheet /Empulse request will not be approved for that / those day/s.

All bench associates designated as Software Associate, Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer need to start reporting at Unit 1, 2nd Floor, (A-wing) where systems are reserved for them.  

 

2.    Upload / Update your resume in proper CG format on R2D2 portal along with skills. (Guidelines stated below). Please ignore, if already done. For everyone’s information, the link to upload resume has been changed. We no more use RMG portal. There is a new portal in place, called R2D2 (people analytics). Please follow the new link given in the Guidelines stated below and check if your resume is already uploaded. If not, kindly upload your resume on this portal ASAP. If your resume already appears on R2D2, ensure that it is updated with the latest information. Same is to be followed for skills. For updating skills too, there is a separate link given in the below mail other than erstwhile RMG. Please cross check and validate the information that is there in the system. Make changes as desired.

 

3.   Change your supervisor (Not to be done by account hires who joined recently): As of now, since you are on bench, kindly change your supervisor immediately to the ones mentioned in the below table based on your designation, practice and/or sub-practice (refer details in the below table). It is crucial that you make supervisor name change since this may affect different approvals (leave applications, attendance regularization, transfers, L & D, clearances (in case you resign when on bench) to name a few) that you may require while you are on bench. Before changing your supervisor, ensure you have got all your previous requests (Leaves, Comp offs, Empulse, shift allowances (if any), iconnect tickets (if any) etc.) cleared from your account / previous supervisor. In an event where you don’t get the previous requests cleared, all such requests will flow in to your new supervisor’s queue and he / she may reject all these requests since they might not be the concerned person for the said approvals.

 

Please follow the below path for changing the name of your supervisor. Kindly do not change the name of your appraiser and only change it when you get deployed. Your new appraiser will be your new supervisor whom you will be reporting to after being deployed:

 

Path: iconnect >>My information >> Professional information >> Supervisor name (There is no separate option to edit the field. You just need to erase the existing contents and type the name of the new supervisor.)
